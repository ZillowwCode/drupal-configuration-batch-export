[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following module installed:

- [Config Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_suite)

## Usage

1. Navigate to Configuration Â» Development Â» Configuration synchronization.
2. Click on the "Batch Export" tab.
3. By default, the config files will be split into chunks of 40 config files. Adjust this value based on your server resources. A higher value speeds up the export but may increase server load.
4. Once the export is complete, your configuration will be automatically downloaded in ZIP format.
5. Voila! You've efficiently exported your entire website configuration in seconds, thanks to the Batch API.
